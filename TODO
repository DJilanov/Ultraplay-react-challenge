Overview:
- The task is to create a client side application that consumes our eSports feed.

- The solution should enable users to view all matches for eSports.

- Users should also be able to group matches by event.

- Users should receive live updates.

Implementation details:

- In this repository you will find a simple Node.js server that exposes a single endpoint: '/matches'. Calling that endpoint will give you access to all the data you need to complete the task.

- You must show all Matches from the endpoint with the following data: Match name and date, the first match Bet and it's Odds (For reference see https://beteast.com/esports)

- The default view should be all matches sorted by StartDate but there should be an option to group the matches by Event

- You should send a request to the endpoint every 10 seconds and apply any changes (for example: Odd Value changed, Match created or removed)

- You are free to use framework of your choice - React (recommended), AngularJS, Angular

Note: All words in italics match to properties in the data so that it's easier for you to navigate.

Please follow the best coding practices, principles, clean and readable code.

Good visual representation is considered a bonus, but is not a must.
